/**
 * @beta
 * The Compound Block Volume is a collection of individual
 * block volume definitions which, as a collection, define a
 * larger volume of (sometimes non-contiguous) irregular
 * shapes.
 * This class is loosely based on the concept of CSG
 * (Computational Solid Geometry) and allows a user to create
 * complex volumes by building a stack of volumes and voids to
 * make a larger single volume.
 * For example - normally a creator would create a hollow cube
 * by creating 6 "wall" surfaces for each face.
 * With a Compound Block Volume, a creator can define a hollow
 * cube by creating a single outer solid cube, and then
 * defining a further single 'void' cube inside the larger one.
 * Similarly, the Compound Block Volume can represent irregular
 * shaped volumes (e.g. a tree consists of a trunk and lots of
 * leaf cubes which are not necessarily contiguously placed).
 * Each of the volumes added to the CompoundBlockVolume are (by
 * default) relative to the origin set (either at construction
 * or via one of the set functions).
 * However, it is also possible to push volumes to the compound
 * collection which are absolute in nature and are not affected
 * by origin changes.
