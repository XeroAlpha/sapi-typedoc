/**
 * A BlockVolume is a simple interface to an object which
 * represents a 3D rectangle of a given size (in blocks) at a
 * world block location.
 * Note that these are not analogous to "min" and "max" values,
 * in that the vector components are not guaranteed to be in
 * any order.
 * In addition, these vector positions are not interchangeable
 * with BlockLocation.
 * If you want to get this volume represented as range of of
 * BlockLocations, you can use the getBoundingBox utility
 * function.
 * This volume class will maintain the ordering of the corner
 * indexes as initially set. imagine that each corner is
 * assigned in Editor - as you move the corner around
 * (potentially inverting the min/max relationship of the
 * bounds) - what
 * you had originally selected as the top/left corner would
 * traditionally become the bottom/right.
 * When manually editing these kinds of volumes, you need to
 * maintain the identity of the corner as you edit - the
 * BlockVolume utility functions do this.
 *
 * Important to note that this measures block sizes (to/from) -
 * a normal AABB (0,0,0) to (0,0,0) would traditionally be of
 * size (0,0,0)
 * However, because we're measuring blocks - the size or span
 * of a BlockVolume would actually be (1,1,1)
