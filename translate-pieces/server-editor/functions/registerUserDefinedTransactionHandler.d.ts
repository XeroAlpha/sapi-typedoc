/**
 * @remarks
 * Creates a strongly typed transaction handle to enforce type
 * safety when adding user defined transactions. This function
 * is a wrapper around the more generalized transaction manager
 * API for script based transactions. Any Editor Extension that
 * needs to insert data into the transaction log for undo/redo
 * should use this function to create a handler for the
 * specific type of data that needs to be inserted. When a
 * transaction is undone/redone, the associated handler
 * function will be invoked with a copy of the payload data
 * that was inserted into the log. As a general rule,
 * transaction data should contain 2 things:<br> 1. The data
 * that will be used to perform the operation we're trying to
 * record<br> 2. The data that will be used to restore the
 * state of the program to what it was before the
 * operation.<br> NOTE/WARNING:<br> The payload data is
 * serialized to JSON before being inserted into the
 * transaction log and the underlying implementation uses the
 * JSON.stringify() function to serialize the data. Any
 * non-primitive data, such as classes or minecraft native
 * objects will not serialize to JSON properly, so you should
 * avoid using them as payload data.
 *
 * @param transactionManager
 * A reference to the TransactionManager (from the extension
 * context for your extension)
 * @param undoHandler
 * A function that will be invoked when the transaction is
 * undone. The function will be passed a copy of the payload
 * data that was inserted into the transaction log.
 * @param redoHandler
 * A function that will be invoked when the transaction is
 * redone. The function will be passed a copy of the payload
 * data that was inserted into the transaction log.
 * @returns
 * - {@link UserDefinedTransactionHandle} - A strongly typed
 * transaction handle that can be used to add transactions to
 * the transaction manager.
