/**
 * @remarks
 * Registers an editor extension into Minecraft. This function
 * calls underlying functionality to register an extension but
 * provides helpful and contextual wrappers for individual
 * client lifetimes. The onActivation function is called
 * whenever a client joins a session, while the shutdown is
 * called when a client leaves. There may be other
 * circumstances in which these are called as well based on
 * client state that is an implementation detail of the system.
