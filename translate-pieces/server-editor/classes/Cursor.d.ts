/**
 * The 3D block cursor is controlled through this read only
 * object and provides the Editor some control over the input
 * methods, display properties and positioning of the 3D block
 * cursor within the world.
 * The 3D block cursor is a native object which is constantly
 * calculating a screen/mouse -> world raycast, and recording
 * the resultant block collision position and facing direction.
 * Depending on the properties of the cursor state, this is not
 * always true â€“ the cursor can also be manually manipulated by
 * keyboard input and moved around independently of mouse
 * movement; when the mouse is moved, the block cursor will
 * return to the mouse/world ray intersection point.
 * The cursor can also be set to either block or face mode;
 * block mode represents the block the mouse is pointing at,
 * and face mode represents the adjacent block that the mouse
 * is pointing at (i.e. the block attached to the face of the
 * intersection point).
 * In practical use, each tool when activated grabs the current
 * cursor state object and stores it.  The active tool then
 * sets the current state to represent the functionality of the
 * tool (color, input mode, etc).  When the tool loses focus,
 * it restores the cursor state using the stored state object
 * that was grabbed during activation.
 * The 3D block cursor can also be used to query the current
 * block at which the mouse is pointing (or the current block
 * to which the cursor has been manually moved by the user)
