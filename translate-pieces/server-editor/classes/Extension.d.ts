 * Editor Extensions are the basis for all player specific,

 * context of an {@link ExtensionContext}
 * When the script manager initializes during level loading,
 * the scripts are loaded from the behavior packs and executed.
 * As part of the global execution context, the scripts are
 * free to register any number of extensions.
 * An Editor Extension is defined a name, an activation
 * function and a shutdown function.
 *
 * It is not recommended to directly use this function as the
 * contract is not guaranteed to be stable, instead prefer
 * {@link registerEditorExtension} as it provides additional
 * functionality and a stable contract.
